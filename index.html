    <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
        <p><h3>pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.these harmful materials are called pollutants.
            pollutants acn be natural,such as volcanic ash.they can also be created by human activity,such as trash or run of
            produced by factories.
            Pollution is a state when an adverse change takes place in the natural environment due to the introduction
            of contaminants. it can be caused by a variety of chemical substances or energy like smoke, foreign
            particles and dust,and excess noise or heat,or sound are called pollutants.

        <p><h3>pollutants the components of pollution,can be either foreign substances/energies are naturally occuring
            contaminants.pollutions has widespread consequences on human and environmental health.
            Pollutants cause disturbances not only in the environment but also in the living entities.
            Tthese foreign bodies enter the human body via the food chain and also impact the ecological balance,
            even in the tiny amounts. This paragraph on pollution is an answer to the definition of polltion.
    <center><h2><u>Different Types Of Pollution</u></h2>
    <p><h3>There may exist numerous causes of pollution for different types of pollution that include:</h3></p></center>
    <center>
        <h2><il>Air Pollution</il></h2>
         <h2><il>Water Pollution</il></h2>
         <h2><il>Soil Pollution</il></h2>
        <h2><il>Noise Pollution</il></h2>
        <h2><il>Radioactive Pollution</il></h2>

        <center><h2><u> Air Pollution</u></h2></center>
        <p><h3>The release of harmful contaminants including toxic gases,particulates,biological molecules,chemicals,etc. into the environment is called air pollution.
            Gaseous pollutants for damaging the atmosphere include carbon monoxide,chloroflurocarbons(CFCs),sulfur dioxide,
            and nitrogen oxides that are produced by industry and motor vehicles.</h3></p>

        <center><img src="c:\Users\prave\OneDrive\Pictures\p6.jpg"></center>
        <p><h3>Air pollution detrimental to health. The causes of pollution in the air can be many and some of 
            the common causes are briefly explained.Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor 
            environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modified the natural characteristics of the 
            atmosphere.</h3></p>
    <center><h2><u> Water Pollution</u></h2></center>
    <p><h3> Water Pollution is one of the types of environmental pollution that has harmful effects widely.
        It is caused when water bodies like rivers, seas,and lakes get polluted with toxic matter.
        The particulates and unwanted contaminants are generally inroduced by humans via activities such as oil spills,
        disposal of industrial waste into water and sewae treatment.</h3></p>
        <center><img src="c:\Users\prave\OneDrive\Pictures\p8.jpg"></center>
        <p><h3>Other reasons may be natural processes like algae blooms, volcanoes, floods, animal waste  
              storms,etc. Water polltion is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human
              activities, so that it negatiely affects its uses. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans,
              aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater.</h3></p>
    <center><h2><u> Soil Pollution</u></h2></center>
    <p><h3> Soil Pollution refers to the contamination of soil with anomalous concentrations of toxic
        substances. It is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazard.</h3></p>
        <center><img src="d:\organic picture\turmeric picture\species picture\oranganic\s1.jpg"</center> 
        <p><h3>Soil pollutionis defined as the presence of toxic chemicals in the soil,in very high concentrations
            to pose a resk to human health and the ecosystem. or in simple words alteration in the natural soil due to
            human activities is termed soil pollution.
            For example,exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene can increase the risk of soil pollution
            diseases like contracting leukemia.</h3></p>
    <h2><u>Noise Pollution</u></h2>
    <p><h3>Noise pollution,or sound pollution,is the propagation of noise or sound with ranging
            impacts on the activity of human or animal life,most of which are harmful to a degree.
            The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines,transport and propagation systems.</h3></p>
    <center><img src="c:\Users\prave\OneDrive\Pictures\n1.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"></center> 
    <p><h3>Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and well
            being of humans and other organisms.sound is measured in decibels.</h3></p>
    <h2><u>Radioactive Pollution</u></h2>   
    <p><h3>Radioactive contamination,also called radiological pollution is the deposition of or presence 
            of radioactive substances. The deposition or introduction of radioactive substances into the envionment,whee their
            preaence is unintendd,or the levels of radioactivity are undesirable.</h3></p>
    <center><img src="d:\organic picture\turmeric picture\species picture\oranganic\r1.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"></center>
    <p><h3>Radioactive nuclei are nuclei that areunstable and that decay by emitting energetic
    particles such as photons,electrons,neutrinos,protons,uentrons,or alphas. Some of these particles are known as ionizing particles.</h3></p>
<h2><u>Light Pollution</u></h2>
<p><h3>Light pollution,the excessive or inappropriate use of outdoor artificial light is affecting human health wildlife behavior and our
ability to observe stars and other celestial objects. That earthly sky glow.Lighy pollution is a global issue.
Light pollution is the presence of unwanted,inappropriate, or excessive artificial lighting.
the term lighy pollution refers to the effects of any poorly implemened lighting,during the day or night.</h3></p>
<center><img src="d:\organic picture\turmeric picture\species picture\oranganic\l1.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"></center>
<p>Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day,its effects are magnified during the night
    with the contrast of darkness. It has been estimated that83percent of the world's people live under light polluted
    skies and that23percent of the world's land area is affected byskyglow.</p>
